 Remake of the old retro game "Breakout".

The main purpose of this project is to learn more about some Unity effects.

For this reason I've created a remake of a pretty basic game concept ([Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game))) and made it more **juicy**.

Effects used:
* Tweening
* Sounds
* Particles
* Lights
* Camera Shake
* ...


The whole idea is strongly influenced by the talk "[Juice it or lose it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)".
